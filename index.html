            The base coat will be applied with a spray gun, so all areas not receiving Plasti-Dip must be masked off. For some minor pieces (like the rear tail lights) it's easier to remove them instead of masking them. The front bumper cover is a hassle to remove but it is still less hassle than masking the intricate curves.

            All glass surfaces were masked off with pink paper that I wasn't going to use for anything else. The wheels and headlights were masked off with thicker paper. Masking with paper was an amateur's mistake: Plasti-Dip is a liquid, and liquid soaks through paper.

            The first coat of Plasti-Dip needs to be a very light coat to adhere properly. It looks terrible but the base coat is important. Mistakes made at one layer usually compounds on all following layers, so the first layer deserves the most effort to get right.

            White is a challenging color to work with due to the poor coverage. My previous Plasti-Dip project turned this car black, and I needed only three coats of black. In contrast, this project required six coats of white before I got to a satisfactory stage. Double the coats means double the chance for mistakes!

            Once I got a solid base coat of white, I peeled off my paint mask. This is where I learned my valuable lesson about masking with paper. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to clean up the soaked-through Plasti-Dip off glass surfaces. It would have been a much messier job if the underlying layer was more Plasti-Dip. In fact I might have to peel everything off and start over.

            The white base layer is now complete, time to set up for the orange accents starting with the wheel arches. I'm also doing the side rearview mirrors at the same time. Since this is the first run with a spray can of high visibility color, I was paranoid about overspray and masked off the entire car.
          </p>
          <p class="flow-text grey-text text-darken-1">
            The mirrors were masked along existing seams between plastic parts, which is a very simple job. The wheel arches were masked following the arches that already existed on the RX-8 body. This was slightly more difficult because (1) there's a slight radius to the edge so it is not precise, and (2) I'm using masking tape designed for straight lines. This is where I begin to value high-quality flexible masking tape for use on curves.

            A solid orange was obtained after three coats of spray. The overspray wasn't as bad as I had feared, so I'll be gradually reducing the plastic masking area to find the right balance between protection and time spent masking.

            The next challenge is to mask out the graphics for the side of the car. Unlike previous stages, this time there is nothing on the car itself to guide me. The circular BB-8 graphic meant it'd be extremely challenging to measure out with a ruler. I turned to video projection to help guide my masking tape. It is not quite a perfect solution because the side of a car is not flat like a proper projection screen. The curved side of the car meant the circle is distorted at the top and bottom so some freehand work was still required to make everything look good.

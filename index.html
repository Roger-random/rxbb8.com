            All areas not receiving Plasti-Dip must be masked off. For some minor pieces (like the rear tail lights) it's easier to remove them instead of masking them. The front bumper cover is a hassle to remove but it is still less hassle than masking the intricate curves.

            All glass surfaces were masked off with pink paper that I wasn't going to use for anything else. The wheels and headlights were masked off with thicker paper. This was an amateur's mistake: Plasti-Dip is a liquid, and liquid soaks through paper.

            The first coat of Plasti-Dip needs to be a very light coat to adhere properly. It looks terrible but the base coat is important. Mistakes made at one layer usually compounds on all following layers, so the first layer deserves the most effort to get right.

            White is a challenging color to work with, because it has poor coverage which requires extra layers before it can keep the underlying color from showing through. Fortunately, after the first coat I can lay on the Plastic-Dip a little more thickly and the white is pretty solid after six coats. In contrast I needed only three coats of black on an earlier project to turn this car black. Double the coats means double the chance for mistakes, and they compound on each other!

            Once I got a solid base coat of white, I peeled off my mask onthe glass surfaces. This is where I learned my valuable lesson about masking with paper in Plasti-Dip projects. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to clean up the soaked-through Plasti-Dip off glass surfaces. It would have been a much messier job if the underlying layer was more Plasti-Dip. In fact I might have to peel everything off and start over.
